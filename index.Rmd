## Project thoughts

As a young voting rights activist and organizer I am interested in studying the impact of different organizing strategies and election administrative policies that mobilize young voters. 

There is a plethora of research being conducted by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (or Circle) at Tisch College of Tufts Univeristy measuring youth turnout and engagement. I would need help tracking down the actual data sets used in these studies but I would like to compare studies such as one done measuring the rate of youth turnout in states where absentee mail in voting was automatic in 2020. 

See: https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016 

An example of an organizing tactic, community outreach, and its impact on engaging youth of color:

I envision being able to use data and studies such as this together perhaps using a left join feature to compare different policies and strategies, make inferences as to whether or not these observations are causal, and last but not  make a conclusion on which policy or strategy has the most impact.
